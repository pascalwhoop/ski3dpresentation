                <strong></strong>incomplete design leads to innovations --> chaos/bad management? leads to innovation?

                <cite class="s">
                    because a big problem here was the <strong>incomplete design</strong>. The shape was there, we
                    always knew the shape,
                    but we didn't know how we were going to create it because <strong>the documents didn't fulfill
                    all</strong>, they
                    didn't cover all the problems. And that's <strong>what they ran into in the field</strong>, was
                    that they had this
                    set of documents that they typically would use and it would tell them everything where they
                    didn't have it. And so even the carpenters in the field became part of the design, because they
                    had to figure out ways to do things....

                    - they suggest that the fact that established communication strategies and formalised paths were
                    NOT present, was the reason for innovation to emerge
                    - 3D imagery supposed to be MORE detailed but now apparently LESS detailed
                    - everyone had to get along with the fact that information was missing
                    - again what if the carpenters didn't do it right then but rather wrong instead?
